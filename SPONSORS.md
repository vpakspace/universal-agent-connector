## Corporate Sponsorship

If your company uses Universal Agent Connector and wants to support its development:

1. **Talk to your engineering team** about the value UAC provides
2. **Estimate cost savings** (time not spent building custom infrastructure)
3. **Compare to commercial alternatives** (easily 10-100x more expensive)
4. **Propose sponsorship** as part of your open-source budget

**Example ROI Calculation:**
- Engineer time saved: 2 weeks/agent × 10 agents = 20 weeks = ~$100K
- Commercial alternatives: $50K-500K/year
- UAC sponsorship: $500-2,500/month = $6K-30K/year
- **ROI: 3-30x return on investment**
